# API and RESTful APIs

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how different software components should interact and exchange data.

One popular type of API is a RESTful API. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are based on a set of principles that make them simple, scalable, and easy to use.
